# Resubmission

## Solved issues

* Title reduced to less than 65 characters;

* Added methodological references to the description field of the DESCRIPTION file;

* Added 'Copyright' field in the DESCRIPTION file. It is now clear and unambiguous that the copyright owner is University of Li√®ge (Belgium);

* Removed `\dontrun{...}` from all examples. In the penPHcure() function, the examples have been wrapped inside `\donttest{...}` as they run in more than 100s. Despite that, most functions are now checked in other examples that run in under 5 seconds (see the `summary.PHcure` and `summary.penPHcure` methods).

## Test environments 

* local: macOS (x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0), R 3.5.3, Apple LLVM 10.0.0

* win-builder: Windows (x86_64-w64-mingw32), R 3.6.1

* r-hub: Linux Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu), R-devel (2019-11-03 r77361), GCC

* win-builder: Windows (x86_64-w64-mingw32), R-devel
